Cant make the secure router to work
I can register and login
When I paste the bearer token in to headers of updateBook it returns 404 You are not authorized to perform this action error message.
I then pasted the token into authorization and selected Bearer token.
When I pressed send postman returned this message:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Error</title>
</head>

<body>
	<pre>Cannot PUT /api/books/613cdf1bf30c1d7e5c41adc6</pre>
</body>

</html>
